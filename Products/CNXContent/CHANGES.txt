    - Fix problem related to <preformat> rendering messing up EIP (ticket:8262)

CNXContent-0.30
  - cnxml-0.6 (30 Jan 2009)
    - Added support for <title> where <name> used to be
    - Added or modified support for these elements
      - <label>
      - <list>
      - inline <note>
      - <span>
      - <commentary>
      - <newline>
      - <space>
      - <cite>
      - <cite-title>
      - <emphasis>
      - <code>
      - <preformat>
      - <exercise>
    - Adjusted print.css for CNXML 0.6
    - Updated strength graphics with 3 level replacements
    - @list-style-type must take decimal instead of arabic
    - put default label on all titles, even 0.5 ones. use <strong> instead
      of <span> for figure- and table-related labels in order to be able to
      remove some "undo" lines in CSS
    - Remove old-style cnxny styling from quote source links. There are no
      longer any .term-source* classes, so remove references to those.
    - account for the ability to add <title>, <label>, and <caption> to
      <code> that doesn't necessarily have @class='listing'
    - account for the fact that <preformat> can take a <title>. account in
      CSS for the fact that multiple elements are now using <pre> as an
      output, not just <code>
    - add styling for @effect attribute values to the print stylesheets
    - Since labels are now being generated by default at the <exercise>
      level instead of the <problem> level, we shouldn't produce default
      labels for qml <item>s when their parents are <exercise>s. Fix qml.xsl 
      to have headers whose HTML output match what we're doing now elsewhere 
      (more accessible headers, and things in generic labels instead of specific spans). 
      Also improve general appearance of problemsets.
    - Put any <label>s, <title>s, and <caption>s of a table all into the
      same HTML <caption> element
