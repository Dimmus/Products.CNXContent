Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.CNXContent.Extensions.Upgrade import *
    >>> from Products.CNXContent.Extensions.Upgrade import addCustomStylesheetExternalMethods
    >>> from Products.CNXContent.Extensions.Upgrade import removeCustomStylesFolder
